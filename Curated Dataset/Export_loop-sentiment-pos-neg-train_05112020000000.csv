"Positive","Are all three hosts providing storage/capacity? Or is one a witness? If all three have capacity drives, what'd you do with the witness? (and with them being NUCs, just how are you handling capacity and cache?)  I'm really wondering about two-node performance, as I currently have three hosts but one of them has FreeNAS virtualized and all the disk slots on that host are dedicated for that. I could add a DAS shelf or something, but I am very curious what it's like running v SAN with both capacity/cache only attached to two nodes and as far as the cluster is aware the third host is strictly only a VM host. And if that's where I'm heading, is the StarWind route going to offer something for performance and reliability with two storage nodes that VMware vSAN wouldn't be able to match with only two storage nodes?"

"Negative","As a last ditch effort I tried vCenter Converter and am managing to maintain a 2Gbps throughput to a Windows VM located on that same host using a different SSD array.  Still nowhere near what it's capable of, but much better.  This should only take an hour or so and hopefully finish.  I never could get the native OVF export to finish downloading the vDisk.  It always stopped the transfer well before reaching 100GB"

"Negative","it is not one of those reasons listed.  I will check the EVC level.  What is odd is that it is not the same for every VM.  I can migrate some VM's in the same cluster to to same host pair but it will give me this error.  Then I can pick a different VM and it will migrate fine."

One has USB3 and 10GB cards (to R510 Freenas) and one is totally stock with both using H700 PERC with SAS drives. I downloaded them via the R640 on Dells support site. note these are homelab systems though but maintain over 40% average load.  &amp;#x200B;  6.7 does NOT support the 5500 series CPUs."

"Negative","No one is responding over there"
"Positive","There is a slightly different method from snapshots you can use that may be the solution you are looking for.   Create your perfect starting VM then shut it down and make the disk non-persistent. Download the vmx file and use it as a template to make other cloned VMs.  You can upload as many VMs as you want, all with independent disks and pointing to the same shared VMDK.    When you want to reset, then you just reset the VM (or power it off). Just make sure the long term developers don't power theirs off or they lose their work.   The question I have though is why you need to roll back your snapshots every night?  You would need a unique base VM still for any Win2k8 servers that interact with each due to the GUIDs - just clone the first, sysprep them and do the same to each.    The more automated way would be to create a vApp and deploy them as needed using scripting at night.   On the DNS issue, I do not understand the problem.  Don't you want the new VM to have the same name and IP?"
"Positive","We are on 6.5 and will be here for at least another 6months to a year.

"Positive","Some versions of 5.5 may not be able to be upgraded to some versions of 6.0. So know what Update/Patch you are on and trying to go to would be helpful.  Also, the reason I ask about 6.5 is that we want to make sure that we're removing all roadblocks to getting customers to 6.5. I understand you may have a requirement for 6.0. If that can be shared, great! If not, no worries."
"Negative","Thanks for asking. I leave this page with no idea of what to choose in order to produce a VMDK for VMware or VirtualBox."

"Positive","Drivel. Zero clients handle 4 screens seamlessly (with the right host). Hell, we've got a triple widescreen demo setup in our office running games at 60fps  - the limitation is the software encoder. GPU in the client does absolutely nothing with pcoip"
"Negative","I had the same issue with VCSA update - Got stuck at exactly the same spot and I left it for about 3 hours. Came back up after a reboot, but obviously not great.  Going to try patching ESXi another day."
"Positive","http://ow.ly/jFSMx  Hear how World Wide Technology is making business transformations for their customers by partnering with VMware."
"Positive","I would monitor the cpu usage for each vm during these tasks. Allowing more resources would probably help improve things.  The shared graphics can also improve performance for certain tasks. If you have a demo video and if the scenario is simple enough to setup I could test it on one of my gpu backed vms to see if it helps much.  The biggest factor though is the latency, I would say that reducing the latency and potentially allowing more cpu resources would vastly improve the experience."

"Positive","This is looking like a pretty small environment - 2 hosts. For that, you could pretty easily get into VMware inexpensively (eg. Essentials or Essentials+).  It will be a bit more expensive than Xen, but is the gold standard with (last I read) about 65% market share."

"Negative"," One day the SSL certificate for VASA expired and all the VMs went offline. Never again.  The VASA provider is required for creating/removing disks and powering VMs on and off, but is not in the data path, and a failure of the provider won't cause any I/O outage. vCenter will likely show all the VMs as missing/orphaned/etc but they will continue to run until you unfuck the provider."

"Positive","Thank you, I will use this method, I'm actually uploading the ISO from my laptop to the server. I wanted to upload the ISO from the USB Stick plugged in the server, but that's fine."
"Positive","That's what I meant - I included performance metrics on the log export.  I see 100 - 300 ms latency on the writes.  However, I can put another datastore on the same aggregate and same host and the latency is &lt; 3ms."
"Positive","Uh, what did you study? You can probably learn most of what you'd need to know on the job and it looks like they're expecting someone with no experience. That said, if you studied engineering, CS, or IT you should probably have some idea of what VMware is and what their software does."

Then one of those guys moved from a development shop to a testing shop, told his friends and boom, I had a second tenant.  /Dev and /QC.

"Negative","Hello,  The person you replied to is correct. This is an issue/bug where vCD constantly sees vCenter in a busy state. You will need to bring down the cells, run the whack script (clears quartz and inventory tables) and restart the cells.  Please open a support case so we can provide the whack script to you with the exact steps.  Sometimes, performing a reconnect and then a refresh will do the trick, but often times it will throw the same error.   Edit: I took a look at the KB, and that is the jist of the whack script. It wouldn't remove the datastore tags, just need to bring the cells down, run the script and bring the cells back online.   I would also ask what version of vCD and vCenter do you have? We've not seen this issue in later versions (typically vcd 5.5.6.1/8.10)"

Further, when your superiors flat out refuse to listen that your software isn't designed for AWS, it's legacy turtles all the way down, none of this cool new containerized microservice stuff, and AWS will lead to data loss and downtime?  I view AWS as an evolution of devs renting a VPS and calling it a robust solution. Despite all the things I've read about ""Devops needing ops"" every time I've seen it done, it looks an awful lot like Devs kicking out ops because they're sick of our nagging about things like availability and data loss."

"Negative","Your issue is the thin provisioning. VMware will present 128GB to the OS even if there is not 128GB worth of space left on the datastore. Once the datastore fills up...game over, you need more physical storage. This is why thin provisioning is both a blessing and a curse. I work for an MSP and there is no way we can keep track of storage like that for 300+ clients so by rule of thumb we ALWAYS use thick provisioning. This way the OS will get it's space and it will be ""earmarked"" on the datastore, if it's not available on the datastore ESXi won't let you create the disk."

"Negative","u/DukieDust Let's get some things straight :).  1. When you are logging in, so you have been authenticated, and you remove yourself from the AD group, you are probably still logged in and can still do stuff. What I'm trying to say here; you don't need to relog (99% of the time) to receive more/less permissions in vCenter. 2. When you use AD based authentication for your users to connect to vCenter, the PSC will handle the SSO stuff and authentication with the Active Directory. This does not mean you are authorized to login! When you do, like you said, you receive an error like the one below (in a big red popping line):`Unable to login because you do not have permission on any vCenter Server systems connected to this client` 3. When you want your users to login to the vCenter, you are going to have to assign permissions on objects. Albeit vCenter, Cluster, Hosts, Folders, VM's etc. etc. 4. So because you can still login, you probably still have permissions on (some) items somewhere in the vCenter Appliance.  As far as I'm concerned there is something funky going on with the permissions you may or may not have assigned somewhere in the vCenter Appliance inventory... Please do check this.  It might also be a timeout issue in the SSO configuration for password expiring aging or something like that. I'd wait an hour, which is the default timeout.  So what you can check;  * Go to Administration - Roles - check each role if you or the Domain Users group is assigned to any role you have in the vCenter. To this this intensly quick use:`Get-VIPermission | ?{$_.Principal -like ""*Thibaut*""}`on a PowerShell session :). * Go to Administration - Global Roles - do the same as the one above. * Remove any unwanted groups that are still there in Administration - Single Sing On - Users and Groups. * Doublecheck the sessions in vCenter like somebody already said before. Just to be sure.     EDIT: I did this exact same procedure on one of our production vCenters, and I am getting the same result as u/DukieDust. Haha alright, this is something funky. I will get back to you guys tomorrow to check and see if it's a timeout thing or not."

"Positive","Backup the VM, rebuild the host as VMware, bare metal restore the VM in VMware.  You will have downtime.  No way around that with another host to migrate to."
"Positive","Well...that is actually pretty normal.  I have had that setup to deal with in nearly every one of my positions.  The only domain info that matters to vCenter and its supporting apps, from an access control standpoint, is the one that it is housed in.  As long as all of your vCenter infrastructure is in a single namespace, then you need not worry about the VMs themselves being disjointed.  Additionally, you can still provide user access from any domain by just adding that domain to the identity sources."
"Positive","I just did this in our Lab to make security happy. They wanted the Lab VC and the Lab ESXi Hosts on their own separate vLAN.   We don't have  management network on a Distributed vSwitch so we took one of the two NIC out of vSwitch0 and created a new vSwitch1 with the new Management IP address and made sure it was accessible via the new IP.  We then changed the vLAN setting on the Lab VC (which is virtual) and changed the IP Address and the DNS entry along with restarting the vCenter Services.   After this was done we deleted the DNS entry for the old IPs for the Lab ESXi machines and moved it over to the new IPs. Once this was done we updated DNS on the Lab VC and all of the hosts reconnected.  One thing that was over looked was that VUM wasn't working since it was originally configured to listen on the IP address which no longer exists. A quick change in the Admin settings and a restart of the services took care of that problem."

"Positive","Appreciate the replies. The current vCenter server 6.5 (Windows based) will not be migrated to vCSA. Only the AD domain will be changed - Windows server running vCenter will be disjoined from old domain and joined to new domain. During this process the FQDN will have changed already. I'm unsure if the old FQDN will be buried/referenced in the vCenter DB and cause issues. If I was using a vCSA - VMware clearly state that the FQDN can't be changed and a redeploy is necessary. But for a Windows based vCenter 6.5 - unsure of same applies. The ESXi changes and SSL regeneration changes are straightforward but unsure if there are other changes required if indeed, changing the FQDN of a Windows vCenter is supported unlike the vCSA."

"Positive","For 12 servers I would almost argue that you are better off going with EC2 or a cloud provider instead of building your own infra. Also I can hardly fathom needing 100k to build an infra to support 12 servers unless they are intense workloads. With 100k you can build a farm to support ~200 VMs at an average size of 2/6."

"Positive","we are an extremely big datacenter. We have so many managed customers and 90% of them are on vsphere 5.5 or 6.0   I have done so many vcenter upgrades in the last 9 years. I will do another one, but i feel i might wanna concentrate on the vCenter Appliance upgrade"

"Positive","I confirmed I am on 6.0 6921384. I am very interested in pursuing this. Maybe in my case using an even older or much newer image would help. I may also try a straight from VMWare image rather than a Dell image. I need to reinstall anyway as I am running out of trial time. I have not cut these into production yet due to the issues."
"Negative","This makes me so sad. I've never been to VMWorld, and I'd love to go, but damn if this didn't make me feel a bit ill. I'm really sorry to hear this."

"Negative","I know your pain. Now that we've moved our dev environment out of 2002 I need to start migrating our legacy systems. They're all on a closed SAN network (no way to tap into...they used the same IP space as my production SAN network with some of my same addresses...joy) and only have 10/100 facing outwards for VM and Management traffic. They have roughly 100 VMs they managed to create in this environment."

"Positive","You sign up for dreamspark with your moodle email account(The gmail one)  This nets you dreamspark access. Don't know how long it will last, my Stanly course ends July 7th.  I'll see if I still have access. I've already downloaded everything and grabbed all the keys. Great for Labbing, I have installs for every SQL server, Windows Server, Visual Studio and so on.  Yes I also grabbed VMware workstation from the Moodle site."
"Positive","So you want to run potentially unsafe software on your desktop system, but use vmware workstation and run it inside of a vm.  Don't know why you are getting downvoted, except for maybe snobbiness toward consumer questions.  Some people just don't like helping unless there's 3 SANs and 12 fiber switches involved.  Simple answer, you're fine and good job thinking to do this.  Alternatively, you can check out sandboxy.  It isolates programs without need for a vm.  If you want to be super careful, monitor and lock down outbound network connections on that machine or just disable networking altogether."

"Positive","Congrats on being #VMwareCertified Pete!!"
"Positive","VMC is managed by VMware SREs, and it has some interesting unique options (stuff like elastic DRS, elastic vSAN).     I'd model out how quickly you would burn through your azure credits. (This is hard as things like data transfer fees are painful to predict).  If it's 3 years of run rate maybe try it out. If it's 3 months meh."

"Positive","The problem with IP HASH is it requires stacked switches.  I prefer to have A/B Separation for VSAN (Separate VLAN's that don't cross switches) and so change made to one switch can't take out both storage fabrics.  Then again I'm an old paranoid Fibre Channel Guy."

"Negative","I've since learned that these things don't mean much, that case has been going on for past 3-4 years &amp; proceedings favour Zerto.   Symantec had a case against Veeam for years, likewise nobody cared and people bought it in droves (Veeam in the past few months won or case was dismissed, can't recall which, its over anyway).  I was talking to a long time EMC rep last month at an exhibition where they were both presenting and he didn't seem bothered at all as EMC have a wider and deeper product portfolio, not just replication and backup."
"Positive","Make sure you find @kmruddy and have him buy you a drink!"
"Negative","Exactly- an unsupported Enterprise array is worse than nothing.   That being said- are all your vms down? That's the real indicator of what you should be doing assuming you can't call support"
"Negative","You finally moved! Bummer. I was traveling a lot in Nov/Dec so I'm just now catching up."
"Negative","yeah. This deployment is a small one of only 4 hosts that runs some citrix stuff so it's the closest thing I have to a test environment. I ended up just writing it off and did a clean deploy and set it all up again. This is after the upgrade migration tool failed also. Can't so much do that on our main VC with close to 90 hosts..."

"Negative","What do you mean you can't login to the ui? I'm talking about in VMware workstation. Also the Nic needs to be e 1000 for esxi."
"Positive","As a Unidesk Certified Professional, I am sorry that you have to use it. I am not a fan of the product anymore after my experience with it. Are you guys using VMware View to broker the connection to the UD desktops? If so, do you allow sessions to stay open? I had to implement the setting on the pools in View that would automatically log off the user if the desktop session was disconnected for X minutes. This would essentially reset the session, and fixed that issue for us."
"Positive","Linked Mode.  AHHHH wouldn't that make life simple.  Unfortunately all the vCenters are from acquisitions.  So because of network issues I can get to them but they cannot get to each other.    The grand plan is to migrate everything to two VCenters primary and Secondary.  but until then I am going to be wading through drop downs.  PowerCLI is something I have thought of and I guess it would be my easiest method of working with these vcenters.  Also wouldn't hurt my personal knowledge-base in learning to use PowerCLI more often."
"Negative","The Internets are mean sometimes."
"Positive","Congrats Fabian! See you in Vegas"
"Negative","Aww  must be bad if Una can't help! Ignore him! He's not worth it!"
"Negative","i feel like death. oh, how i love being sick."
"Positive"," 10Gbps  Appreciate the perspective. I tend to want to get the best the solution can deliver vs. what is needed. Going to explore your suggestion.  Thoughts on ""fixed"" vs ""most recently used""? Reading the VMware description of ""fixed"" tells me it will fail-over if needed, only if VMware determines the ""fixed"" path at boot. If I select the path...will it not fail over to another available path?"
"Negative","My lack of motivation has defeated me"
"Positive","I'm a little unsure what the OP is talking about here. I've got half a dozen of these that I've updated and not a single one is using a ""real"" certificate. And all of them are working without problems, both HTML5 and the old client."

"Negative","About 2 years ago, me and a group of guys spent almost a month trying to get ArcGIS to thinapp properly, with 4.7.  We got as far as getting to work as long as we only used the thinapp package on the machine we captured it on, before or after we restored it to golden.  I believe we opened a ticket with vmware regarding it, and were basically told ""good luck, we can't figure it out"" but I can't remember for sure anymore.   So, best of luck, but I've never seen it successfully thinapped before."
"Positive","Your lucky you like over there.  GUESS WAT! DREW SENT ME A DIRECT MESSAGE!!!!"
"Negative","sos, burnin up, before the storm and its over?"
"Positive","reply reply reply  haha pweaseee"
"Positive","Thank you. I think this solved it for me. Not 100% sure though because I had also rebooted into maintenance mode as well as changed the swap location using the Web GUI.  I'm pretty sure it was the swap location and not the maintenance mode which solved my ""[Errno 28] No space left on device"" problem though. Good catch!"
"Negative","Support will usually still answer questions during the Technical Guidance phase, but unless you purchase Extended Support (very expensive) Engineering goes full Edna Mode on the product: ""I never look back darling, it distracts from the now. """
"Negative","The last sentence in the 'Note"" section appears to be incorrect.  'When your load balancer is configured to terminate SSL at the load balancer, you can deploy a second connector behind another load balancer to support certificate authentication.'  This does not seem like a valid configuration if SSL is terminated at the load balancer."

"Negative","just found out that alcohol is not vegetarian friendly... Um what?"
"Negative","You're leaving out waaaaaaaaaay too much info for anyone to help you. Are you using ESXi5.5+? Is the VMFS datstore formatted for .vmdks of that size? etc."
"Positive","I'm not sure what the big deal is.  If you set up the machine so it doesn't use the host for time OR point the host at a time server, it should be fine.  Will it be naval observatory accurate?  No.."
"Positive","vCAC would help - you can provide users the ability to create a snapshot, and define policy for age and depth.  vCO could also do it, but you'd have to make a workflow that looked for policy violations that was invoked via a REST call or some other automated method.  Storage DRS could help with mitigating full datastores, but having good monitoring and operational policy is key.  vCAC also gives the user more visibility into what they're consuming, so they can share more responsibility for their use of resources."
"Positive","wiping out the new risk before they actually arise"
"Positive","IMHO  PVLANs do not constitute ""micro segmentation"" and I would not consider PVLAN a thing for scale.  It's good for testing - if you want to clone VMs into networks so they can talk to each other but not out to the world (ie., DC/sharepoint/etc. testing) then they're good for that.  But manageability sucks.  If you're concerned about ransomeware and PVLANs is your solution I would never want to admin that :)"

"Negative","Supported operating systems haven't been updated since 2017.  Really need the documentation to be more up to date."
"Positive","Well I noticed a configuration error I made when I originally came up with a budget for this project (too many capacity ssd's). Well they approved it at the price it was and when I corrected my error and swapped the S3700's to the P3700 it actually ended up cheaper, so we are going to go with that.  As far as our workloads (70/30 r/wr), this cluster is going to be Web/DB (mysql) and an IOP hungry erp system (mssql). We've noticed from experience with this erp system, it behaves alot better the closer the vm is to the disk which was one of our main considerations when choosing vsan for this situation. I have run it over iSCSI on a 10G connection to a beefy Starwind vSAN but it just runs better on storage on the host.  As it sits now I only have one disk group on each host, but it has 2 HBA's built in so I can easily add another disk group on its own HBA in the future when I need more space. I didnt want to get the 400GB NVMe as I thought it would be better to over-provision rather than under, that would be nice though if it ran faster. We have multiple busy seasons a year and scale our web up significantly during these times, I would rather it be overkill than have everything get bogged down at the wrong time."

"Positive","To me, it sounds like Mirage is what you're looking for, more so than Horizon View VDI. Mirage will allow you to ""centralize"" all your workstations and apps to a singular image with app layers4, and allow you to access the physical hardware as well. To push updates, you would simply update the OS layer, and then assign that layer to the workstations. Bam. Updated."

"Negative","If the backup software isn't consolidating it's likely because you have a problem in vmware, if you logged into vmware and clicked consolidate i'd expect it to fail just as it does when the backup software attempts to do it.   In my case the reason that consolidation was failing was due to the fact that the base disk where snapshot on the backup proxies and therefore the base disks are trapped."

I also see the interfaces on my catalyst 3750 going up and down repeatedly.  The switch configs for both hosts are the same.. I mean, different port-channel interfaces, but the same beyond that."

"Positive","Alright, so this is going to be a little funky here, and there is a very good chance of fucking everything up...  If you have any space available, use something like gpartd and create two partitions.  Make one a few gigs in size and give the other partition the rest of the space.  Then install ESXi on to the host.  When selecting and install location, select the partition you created for ESXi.  It MAY show up.  And by may, I mean there is a snowball's chance in hell it does, but it depends on how the RAID controller presents storage to the OS (ESXi).  The indication is essentially a WWN address, followed by a colon and a number.  The number after that indicates the partition.  If you select that, the installer will ask you if you want to format the disk.  You tell it ""fuck no"" and be on your merry.  That should do it.    Aaaand sorry for the formatting.  I do not think I have had enough Jameson."

Then they ignored my warning about adding CPUs to VMs ""My VM is too slow, add RAM and CPU""    I can't patch.  I can't update firmware on UCS chassis.  I am starting to get snippy when they ask me what can be done, then being ignored.  We spent 500k on new HP servers that have been online since February 1st that just this week they starting standing new Citrix XA servers.  I spent 4 weeks working with networking begging them to stop using LACP on my uplinks.  Finally they caved and the flapping stopped.

RDP allows you to ""Drag and Drop"" (actually copy/paste, but same thing since it works with files)."

"Negative","It's gone. Trust me. You can search for .vmdk files (these are the disks) - But I'm guessing you thin provisioned and fedora only took up a few GB so when you deleted it you didn't notice 20gb being freed up, because it didn't take up 20gb in the first place."

"Negative","Sorry to be dim but is this a Windows VM only thing?"
"Positive","never said otherwise. i suggest you already gain experience with the vsphere suite before going a layer up ;) maybe the first thing would be searching some documentation on different vmware products to understand how they articulate between themselves before skipping to ""chapter 250 : download the stuff"" ..."
"Positive","Thank you for the info and that really sucks. I used to manage an Openstack cluster on KVM a few years ago and it was not fun. VIO made things too easy, especially with NSX. I think I am going to build a 3.1 Openstack lab and reverse engineer the configs to build my own. I don't see much help online for people who want to use VMware with Openstack with NSX in play.  Also, I wonder if it will ever get added to VMUG Advantage. I hope it does."

"Positive","Quicker online access to reports and catalogues"
"Positive","The linux vm should remain up all the time.  It's not possible to create snapshots of vms with shared disks.  I've tested my processing with a smb share but there's a perf hit that I'd prefer to avoid, I wouldn't mind using the network if the performance was as good, but I can't figure out how to achieve this."
"Positive","So then you don't need to worry about vMotion, distributed switches or any of the other fancy features of ESXi.  I would suggest you get one to two more hosts and shared storage so you can properly leverage it's capabilities but it sounds like from your host description below that would be significant overkill for you deployment.  You'll be fine with standard."

I went back and looked at the docs and vRA is definitely leveraging the guest specs, so I'm not sure what exactly is going wrong for you.

Once you have your base image, patched and ready to go - consolidate (delete snapshots) and you are gold.   I think in the VDI world, it is done a little differently??  Someone above was implying in VDI world, that many snapshots had no effect on performance. It might be negligible or an acceptable performance hit but I was taking issue with the no effect statement."

"Negative","@SFoskett I'll need Exchange support for that. :("
"Positive","I wouldn't want to run any VMs on a machine with those specs. Windows 10 will fill over 2GB on my machines just idling. You need more RAM, at the least.  If you want to try anyway, you can download both VirtualBox and VMware Player for free, and see how they perform.  My desktop is a cheap ($560) refurbished HP uATX system with a Ryzen 1700, AMD RX550, and 16GB RAM. It came with a slow HDD, but I installed an NVME SSD for the OS and a SATA SSD for the VMs, and just use the HDD for backups. I can run 2 VMs with 2-4 cores and 5GB RAM each and the machine hardly knows they're there. I use VMware Workstation and Linux, but the performance is the same under Windows. Look for a deal on a machine like that with a Ryzen 2nd Gen CPU and you'll be very happy."

"Positive","PDT and as much as I appreciate the offer, you know I can't give you access to our network."
"Positive","To ELI5 let's try an analogy.  Scenario A:  Your storage admin is a bus route planner. They have a number of buses (LUNs) each with a specific number of seats (capacity). The planner has to decide how many buses are going to travel each route (let's say the route is the capability of the LUN). Each bus is identified by a number, like the 902.  The person provisioning the virtual machine is someone trying to get their elderly relative (the Virtual Machine) who was in town visiting to the right destination (the right capabilities). When using a bus (the LUN analogy) they have to figure out which bus to put their relative on by trying to decipher a bus schedule (or spreadsheet mapping LUNs with specific capabilities to datastores). They also have to worry about ensuring they can get the relative onto the bus (that there's enough seats/capacity) and that they don't have to wait for the next bus (or for the storage admin to provision a new LUN with the right capabilities).   Scenario B:  Your storage admin is Uber. They have a number of drivers each with a specific number of seats (capacity). The storage admin has to ensure there are enough drivers to serve their city (based on demand forecasting) and recruiting enough drivers (procuring enough storage).  The person provisioning the VM is trying to deploy their VM (the elderly relative) with the right capabilities. In this scenario they simply request an Uber car to take their relative to the right location. They don't have to worry about waiting for a bus to be ready, or worrying about which other passengers are on that LUN.  Now for ELI I'm a VI admin:  SPBM and VVol turn the conversation from having to preallocate capacity and capabilities to LUNs before you are able to provision a VM, to requesting the capacity and capability your workload requires when you need it and it being configured and consumed dynamically on the storage array.  Storage admins are responsible for setting up their array, the paths to it, and the capabilities it advertises. VI admins are responsible for setting up storage profiles (in SPBM) that use those advertised capabilities, they then use those profiles when provisioning VMs to inform the storage system what capabilities they want to be provided for a particular VM when it is provisioned.  VVols also allows you to offload lots of storage operations onto the array itself (snapshotting cloning etc) at a per VM/Virtual Disk level rather than per-LUN."

"Negative","I'll chime in on this one... Last RAID-5 failure I had was on an EMC NS-960. We had a failed SAS 10K 600GB drive in say DAE 5 Slot 11. The EMC Tech came out, swapped the drive out and left as they normally do. About two hours into the rebuild, DAE 5 Slot 3 failed of the same type. EMC was called back in, Engineering got involved and they spent the next 2 days (without leaving the datacenter) tweaking the rebuilt rates and finagling both drives to keep them up long enough to rebuild. Two days with an entire aggregate offline was hell enough for us that we decided to go RAID-6 on everything.   EDIT: You will note that as of the VNX1 the rebuild rate is MUCH lower... Meaning, it now takes 30% longer to rebuild arrays. This was done specifically to mitigate the types of issues like the one I incurred on my NS-960. However, I know from chaps in the VCE User Group for example that it can and does still happen. Albeit less often, these types of failures are simply par for RAID-5."

Actually i'm testing it with a single VM (and not yet multi select) -- i'm selecting it under the related objects as you have wrote."
"Negative","think i pulled a muscle in my shoulder"
"Positive","I would say altogether we are happy with the modified version of applications"
"Positive","Double check this info, but I'm quite sure the drives cannot have esxi loaded on them. This uses vflash file system instead of vmfs on the disks.   Also there isn't much point in having a raid 1 array for vflash read cache. You'd be better off just having pass through individual disks.   Also on splitting the space between VMs, your much better off finding the VMs with high read IOPS and dedicating more vflash to those."

"Positive","Thank you for the detailed response. The gpupdate thing I kind of suspected.  We did find the solution however, and it was actually something I had baked in to the image, but had not realized my client's domain GPOs were overwriting - They had the ""Always wait for network"" gpo forced OFF on the domain side, so despite baking it in to the image's local GPO it was being overwritten.  Sorry for the dumb question I posed here, and for taking up your time - was just hard to get clarity without visibility on both sides (I architect their horizon and advise them on GPOs, but they do all the GPO architecture and have their own policies layered on top of mine)"

Perhaps they are thinking you would expect them to upgrade the external vCenter, which I can understand would be chargeable as it's outside of their environment.   To upgrade yourself, you would perform the normal vCenter upgrade process. Then to upgrade the hosts and VxRail Manager, you would do that via VxRail Manager using the 4.0.400 bundle."

"Positive","You can't remove a host from a cluster without puting it in maintenance mode. However you can disconnect/remove it. Disconnecting a host only tells vCenter to stop actively managing it. It doesn't halt running VMs or immediately wipe out configurations. You can disconnect/remove hosts from your cluster all day long without losing a single ping on your machines.   VMware does have a KB for how to migrate hosts between vCenter servers using distributed switches though, so I won't bother to regurgitate that from memory."

"Negative","NSX so long as the AV vendor supports it... I believe a bunch still don't.  Hopefully they'll get their shit together before it goes EOL!"

"Positive","@vmtyler @btobia The other thing is that they are very light & the thin walls means more usable space internally."
"Positive","Yes chrome remote desktop is awesome because you have no ports to forward but you will lose all the RDP options.  RDP is just like working on a monitor in front of you where CRD will require you to use chrome. I use CRD for family members who need support and RDP to access my home PC from anywhere including the android RDP app which works well on Windows 10."
"Positive","@alanrenouf I know him too.:) We've talked. Working on interim solution first, long term going forward."
"Negative","Jogging, isnt REALLY that cool, especially if you've got a fever"
"Positive","First you need to check the HCL of the server you are running 5.5 on. If supported you could do an in-place upgrade 5.56.56.7. You will have to upgrade the VMFS version of the datastore from VMFS 5 to 6 before your upgrade to 6.7 but it should be doable if the hardware is supported."
"Positive","Yea a passthrough was in place for the HyperV machine. I did disable the passthough on the Host but probrably didnt matter after i took out the card. However i did not know how to remove the passthrough settings on the HyperV machine running on the Host. I ended up opening the .vmx file and deleting any phrases that started with ""passthrough"" and that worked for me."

"Positive","I scored about the same my first time through. The difference the second time through was anticipating the exam and moving through it as quickly as I could. I didn't get to 3 or 4 the first time around and I easily got through them all the second time. Just keep moving. :)"
"Positive","Does this make sense to do it this way, does VEEAM have a test or validate function?  Sure it does! Called ""Backup Validator Tool"".   http://www.educationalcentre.co.uk/veeam-hidden-feature-backup-validator/"
"Negative","Woke up at 5:30am. Couldn't go back to sleep. It's going to be a loooong day."

"Negative","um..nothing? did i say something wrong? if i did im sorry"
"Negative","At least the HTML5 client isn't hot garbage that runs slow as piss like the ""old"" web client."
"Positive","That is true. If Nvidia cards detect that they are in passthrough mode, they won't work.   You need a Grid card."
"Positive","Figured out what my issue was, the builder was not configured properly.  Im good here."
"Positive","I will check out SIOC, thank you!"
"Positive","Why not look at VCAP6 instead. vSphere 5.5 has less than a year left before it is End Of Support."
"Positive","I agree that there were good people in Burlington, but Colorado also has amazing engineers there, both in Production and Premiere support groups."
"Negative","Or can the app get broken apart to different servers? Are they running the database, application, web servers, interfaces from the same server? Try breaking individual pieces apart and getting the vendor to confirm what everything needs.   We run into this a lot. You want an application that needs a 16 core VM? Great here is a quote for a new host. Let me know how you want to pay for it. To this day no VM has gotten more than 4 cores. Amazing how quickly attitudes change when you present a bill."
"Positive","Looking forward to representing VMware at this year's @GoldmanSachs Technology and Internet Conference. #GSTech2017"
"Negative","Not enough detail, an example of the settings in actual use would help."
"Positive","If the servers can support 2 CPUs (but only being shipped with 1), instead of worrying about adding more nodes and changing licensing in the future, OP can buy a 2nd CPU and more RAM for the 3 nodes he has.  Essentials and Essentials Plus support up to 2 CPUs in each server.       And in modern servers, the CPU is the memory controller.  So adding a 2nd CPU also doubles the memory capacity of each server."
"Negative","Forgot the white part.Was gonna make SS shirts up,IDK .Chicago,Detroit,Cinci aren't looking good mybe just NY/NJ shows"

"Positive"," an Renouf has a great script alread  Sorry for not being more clear, yes I am talking about the total processing power of the cluster. I'm trying to find out the difference between the symptoms when the processing power gets closed to 100% used and when there are to many vCPU's per pCPUs.  Thanks for the script, will give it a shot."
"Negative","The interconnects themselves are Cisco/brocade or uplink to Cisco/brocade switches?  It's very odd to have 2 different vendor interconnects and / or upstream switches."
"Negative","I really hope persiankiwi is safe.  &quot;Persian Kiwi is in Trouble&quot; http://ow.ly/fNta #IranElection Iran"

"Negative","So it appears as if my days of an easy summer with a lighter work load are OVER!!!  My summer work load is something SERIOUS!!"
"Positive","no, you need VMCA for the all the magic to work. VMware is not really a free platform.   If you really need Bitlocker on a VM you can pay for ESX, its actually not very expensive!"
"Positive","You could also look at other products like Zerto to do the migration as well.  As others have said, getting an eval license may be be your best bet."
"Negative","You obviously are getting down voted by juniors who don't appreciate someone cracking a whip.  It's not all redfacetwit and FarmVille."
"Positive"," and apprently its doable via PowerCLI   yep, so you just google: disk format from THIN to THICK powercli"
"Positive","No problems at all with joining the domain. 10/10 times when there is a problem, its DNS."
"Negative","FF extension no working with 61.0.2 & @tweetbot getting screwed by @twitter & @jack. This is a great start to the weekend. :(\n\nSeriously Jack, Twitter's apps suck. Deprecating the use of API's will be Twitters undoing. This is a dumb move."
"Positive","What kind of host hardware are you running? We ran into a similar issue, it ended up being the host's NIC drivers (Intel x710 i think). As soon as we updated to a current driver, all the bizarre arp and LACP issues disappeared. The bad driver was packaged as part of Cisco's custom 6.5 ISO. Still is, in fact."
"Negative","Not really good days for Germany regarding new laws being passed at the moment"
"Negative","I think I'm going to have to try the license thing.  It would appear that OVA import on 6.7.0 isn't working for some infernal reason.  Each upload attempt just stops out of the gate with ""File not found"" errors."

"Positive","How is it only 6,000 per month?  The 8.37 is per host, with 4 host minimum which means the cost is really 24.00+ per hour."

"Positive","I dunno, that Musk guy has a much better hair line now.."
"Negative","*Oh god.*  I cannot believe I did not remember that the snapshot contains ALL the info up to date. I remember now a similar lesson in my personal lab...   Not that it would have helped considering he went ahead and did it without a backup before I even knew what was going on.  He's saying that he deleted it through the vCenter GUI. While I agree that he should have been less hasty in deleting the snapshot, what do you make of the message that the VM has reverted to the snapshot seemingly without manual interference ?"

"Negative","I had not tried that, but I just tried it and it typed the password correctly.  I figured something similar might be happening (this keyboard has done some weird stuff in the past, but normally not with typing), so I tried configuring the password network information through the iDRAC virtual console, but had the same issue.  Not a bad idea though!"

"Positive","Veeam Endpoint is free and also supports scheduling, however, it's not a native vmware snapshot based backup (mainly used for bare metel servers). I use it for customers who can't afford to pay for the full license and it works great! I've used it for doing P2V transitions."

"Negative","No, I would not have. Although Bernie is at least consistent in his message & doesn't pander, he doesn't get economics. He wants socialism"
"Positive","I've done it this way on 3 separate occasions, and has worked without an issue. If you can't get away with turning the VM off you may have to use a host as a transition avenue, as long as it can see both the networking and storage you'd just have to do a number of disconnect/reconnects between vCenter's to shepherd the VM's."
"Positive","We've been working on some Cisco studying so we can offer the same (already sell plenty of EMC and Cisco networking, but we haven't attained ""Datacenter"" qualification yet). Glad to hear you're having good luck with it!"
"Positive","This is not direct answer, but you should consider migration to vCenter Appliance usage instead. You can use well rounded Migration workflow for this.  *Remark*: I run consultancy service in this area, feel free to DM for private assistance."
"Positive","Sure thing. It's rather an expensive service to be perfectly honest, but great for large organizations where they can afford it plus that extra attention is a must."
"Positive","To add to this vCAC also gives you the ability to allocate and manage resources based on the requesting user's role,  department,  etc to limit for example how long a VM can live.  While you could create deployment and destruction workflows in vCO, doing so would be cumbersome and not worth the time.   Orchestrator also has a lot of plugins to automate external infrastructure like Infoblox or Cisco UCS whereas plugins for vCAC are limited or being moved to Orchestrator.  Using Orchestrator can bring immediate value in automation and the workflows can be integrated with vCAC when self service is desired."
"Negative","I take it ESXi is unable to clean up after itself and/or clear partition from a disk by itself. Incredibly stupid."
"Positive","Softball game tonight cancelled...  To many stores have RZ events. Mark that up as another &quot;W&quot; for us!"

"Positive","I'm running the latest version 6.7 and have been for about 4 months.  It's been rock solid.  No issues at all.  Yes - it will work with 6.0 (any version) but nothing that's 5.x.  HTML5 is the future.  The Flex (Flash) client is being phased out.  I like 6.7 because the HTML5 client is pretty much full featured in it.

"Negative","I actually called into vmware and the support guy said only the latest version would be offered. I saw a drop down on the download page that said I was not authorized and would need to register for a trial but, when I dot the the actual download page for the trial, there was no drop down asking for a version."

"Positive","Thanks for the clarification - I had thought you could 'demo' on the test track and sit the actual exam @ VMworld!!"
"Positive","haha i couldn't, my dad is watching tv"
"Positive","I can't speak on running bundled vNICs, however, in ESXi 5.0 and 5.5 we've been experiencing a bug where portgroups that are set to trunk mode will randomly stop passing any traffic. From within the VM it appears as if the NIC is still up and everything is normal, but no packets will go through (I've only noticed it on CentOS, but none of our Windows VMs have any trunk NICs.) Restarting network service generally gets traffic flowing again. it would be interesting to experiment with bundled NICs to see if they both go down at once or not."

"Negative","Its such a nice day beside the fact that its like 100 degrees outside and we're moving. I wish I could go to the beach instead"
"Positive","There a reason you're stopping at 5.1?  I'd seriously look at 5.5 if at all possible; SSO introduced in 5.1 (if using vCenter) was buggy as heck; 5.5 made serious improvements.  (I haven't worked with Essentials, only Free standalone hosts and Enterprise/Plus with vCenter Standard)"
"Positive","Thank you. It's well done. You are the 4th person to tell me."
"Positive","Mellanox SX1024 might be of interest to you (48Port 10GbE + 12 40GbE/56GbE ports). For us we only need the SX1016 (64 port 10GbE) but the price p/port was unbeatable and delivered in our requirements for performance with our EMC arrays.

"Positive","Worth mentioning here that VeeamFree can be scheduled using PowerShell (they're own blog has a sample script on how to use it), but you are correct that there is no incremental support (and apparently no application aware guest processing)"
"Negative","I architected the Horizon View VDI environment for one of Dell Services largest customers. They had Unidesk, and I migrated all 500+ users off to Horizon with App Vols. Unidesk is great in theory, but it didn't work in prod for us. I was manually reBIC'ing the same desktops daily. Having to manually extract data from corrupt VDI daily. Opened numerous support cases and only got 1-off fixes and promises for better performance in the next versions. It never came, so we left."
"Positive","I did that (had to realize i need to enable vmotion on the NIC first): manual vmotion works without any issues, HA test infact also. After the warning is shown i need to wait another 30 seconds and then the VM is up. I guess i was just thinking this whole HA thing would happen in a small time span. Telling your customers this might take 5 minutes is toally normal from your experience right? Thanks btw.!"
"Positive","Can confirm this works. I just got a license key from VMUG to upgrade VSphere 6.x to Enterprise edition with Operations Management, until 31/08/2020  It's only valid for home lab setups, not production, but its still an awesome deal"
"Negative","Interesting, I will give that a try.  EDIT: After deleting all of the snapshots for the VM the issue persists."
"Positive","This is very very very easy with Veeam Free editon, I will post a link in a bit when I find it"
"Positive","So, I just decided to try again, but this time I chose one specific host in the destination cluster instead of the cluster itself (and also chose normal vMotion instead of high priority) and it's going over like it should now. Weird."
"Negative","Regarding virtual appliance, the information that the file krb5.conf is located at /etc is given too late. So at the first glznce on the page, the reader has a wrong impression that  the file has to be in /usr/java/jre-vmware/lib/security/ .\nPlease modify the contents accordinly to what is REALLY on the appliance"
"Negative"," I spent a good 3 days fiddling with it before I just gave up and rebuilt it  I'm a day and a half in and decided to ask here before moving forward with anything. On our environment it's not much of an inconvenience to delete all associations and rebuild.  We do have an active SnS agreement with vmware across all sites, but their support often isn't very helpful with these kind of things."
"Positive","Good thought, but cert is good through 2020."
"Positive","You can create a new vcenter server and point your system DSN to the existing database.  That will work like a champ."
"Negative","Susan Boyle should have won the BGT  her voice is AMAZING...but i guess for some people this is not enough"
"Positive","Well I do not have the money for the DVC track, if it still requires a 3k course.  Thanks for the information provided."
"Positive","I tested it on vCenter 5.5 U3e and it's working correctly."
"Positive","In our environment we actually manage replication of VDP in a few ways. We have straight VDP to VDP replication, but also have VDP to Avamar, and VDP to DataDomain which replicates to an offsite DataDomain appliance.  I think hands down it's a great product. I just wish the management console was a bit better. It's not as simple as something like the Avamar console to dig into a particular job and workout why it failed etc."

"Positive","Yep - in the process of doing that now, thanks."
"Positive","BTW: the Essentials package for $500 will cover cold migrations."
"Positive","Generally, the course is much more than 1500. Like 3-4k if you go through one of the big cert partners. Though, the course can be had for a few hundred bucks through one of the online Community Colleges (Such as Stanly CC). But you won't get the v6 class from them. They're doing 5.5 right now.  Also, you can sit the exam whenever you want. No need to take during / right after the class, unless you're ready. Though, some of the classes give a discount voucher that expires. Sometimes after a year or so."
"Positive","I thought i got a respond and my heart droped a lot and i got excited but then i realized it wasn't me...  sdhnashdnas! ha"
"Positive","Indeed :)  Even then, he only said about as much as you said.   From what I've been hearing (what little that is) I'd like to believe that VMware has something shiny in the works. I'll keep my eyes open for it.    As for the empty platitudes.... Every VMware employee I have dealt with has been great. I'll leave it at that."

"Positive","Thank you very much for the feedback and help ..  Iaindings, you are right, the real issue is I am unable to upgrade to Vista, I've copyed the XP VM  to a new custom VM  (pointed that to a folder with a copy of my XP VMDK files.) Once I tried to upgrade this 'new' VM to Vista I got a error indicating the BIOS where too old."

"Negative","This is what worries me about cloud only and Iaas services.   No one is around that keeps up with that bad month of patching and you then have down systems because of it.   I'm hoping Microsoft is now testing patching on aws and google but it's very possible they don't.  Same as how they should test on VMware, hyperv servers.  Maybe even xen like they would dell, hp or Lenovo."
"Positive","There are some PowerCLI scheduled tasks you can run to check if a pool is disabled. I originally started to muck about with it and crashed my connection server. That was the last I attempted to get any alerting. I've changed jobs since then and am no longer a View admin. (Was not fired for crashing the connection server. :D)"
"Positive","Net.NetPktSlabFreePercentThreshold - It's just a warning threshold. If it's set to 2 right now, raise it to 10 and you will be fine.  VSAN-iSCSI.ctlWorkerThreads - Who's telling you that this value should be -1? If the allowed range is between 0 and 4294967295, -1 can't be a valid option in vSphere 6.5. :D"
"Positive","I absolutely could, though it might help some customers who prefer to see something more ""official"" aka from KB. I'm still waiting to hear back, but if not, I'll publish it on my own Github/Blog to share as its already helped several large customers"

"Negative","We have had our vSphere lab (only product testing and demonstration use) running on vSphere 6 since April and I have never seen this issue to occur on our ESXi hosts (4 x Cisco UCS C-Series rack servers).  I wouldn't upgrade production systems yet though, and this is what I am telling our customers also."

"Positive","That's how i've done it before. But likely not an option here. I hate recoverpoint. Thank you though, is a reasonable idea generally."
"Positive","You should be able to move the drives from the 6i to the H710 and the new controller will pick up the configuration and you can import the virtual disk. This really isn't an ESXi question but a Dell RAID question. But anytime you are monkeying around with your storage like this, you should always have a backup. Always."

"Negative","About vSphere 7, they edited the release notes. Yesterday it was included. It seems VMware had a problem with it."
"Negative","Statement: Create a resource pool of the hosts in the management domain is not correct. Should read: Create a resource pool in the management domain (remove of the hosts) - Marek Zdrojewski"
"Positive","Oh ok cool, I could care less about configurations most of the time it's just to connect to something that's ""stuck"" or not working right. Thanks for the reply"
"Positive","Sounds like misconfigured SQL servers to me. Check memory settings in your SQL instance. Also check if the servers are using thick disks, thin disks can cause performance issues.   And get rid of the resource pools or configure them correctly."
"Negative","The cynic in me suspects that is exactly the reason they don't list them. It really rubs me the wrong way when I see VMware employees claiming the HTML5 client supports up to 90% of ""general workflows"". Sure it does, if you don't count the majority of the things it does not support against that metric :D"

"Positive","Even if GPU passthrough is working, there's too much overhead and bottleneck from the hypervisor to the guest OS.  I have tons of Nvidia Tesla cards here at work, these things will blow away any of your home built virtual machines.  Nvidia has a special driver that allows much better GPU passthrough.  I think with the amount of Tesla cards here, I can easily host a game streaming service here but they are being used for machine learning and AI."
"Positive","tell me it's 7.5.1! I will dig into it, thanks!"
"Positive","Thank you, that worked, i totally forgot that i had increased the allocated memory to 4GB, it works perfectly now :-) Is there any way that i can let it use 4GBs of my RAM without running into this issue?"
"Positive","Thanks guys, yes, I've had trouble in the past, but cannot remember the exact circumstance. That article unfortunately is clear as mud or maybe it's just me. :) I believe ERSPAN works across hosts so if you select a source port/vm on host1, host2 and host3 using ERSPAN, it will mirror all of them to the destination. However, I don't think the other methods behave that way. Finding a definitive answer on this topic is really tough."

"Negative","no actual pricing on vCenter licenses"
"Positive","If you are trying to use flash in browser, you might want more a client based hypervisor, like horizon...using vm's as clients can be problematic if you expect the cpu to act as a gpu and then still be able to rdp all that you your screen far away.  ESXi is definitely a good upgrade from workstation pro, but depending on what you want to do as the endgame you might still need other things...  Remember this, chances are your server doesn't have a graphics card...and chances are you are not virtualizing the gpu (if you had one installed) and presenting it to your thin client either..."
"Positive","You might check out the Invicta UCS bundles too if you have any need for some sweet ssd storage. They're actually a surprisingly good deal with four blades, UCS interconnects, chassis and Invicta storage system."

"Positive","You are right, they typically are retrained, and hopefully they are moved to a role that is even more directly aligned with the org's mission, which increases productivity. In some cases individuals can be shifted to a different cost center also."
"Positive","No change at our physical or virtual layer.  We were discussing doing a ucs manager update due to the NTP bug for the version we're running now on the FI's.   I feel like if fexes were going out, vm's would have lost connectivity as well, and not just hosts.  All the vm's on the hosts stayed up the entire time so no one even noticed all the panic at the vmware level which was nice :)  I've looked over the vpxd log but nothing is sticking out, and vmware has had my logs all day and not a word from them, so I'm guessing they haven't found anything yet either."
"Positive","I've had the pleasure of working with remote hands a few times. I guess I've just been lucky. They also didn't have to deal with storage so that helps I'm sure lol."

"Negative","what a jerk!!! I'm suppose to be your fav"
"Negative","I'm not even sure that is an option anymore.  The only options you can for memory allocations global to Workstation. It looks like you can indeed select ""Fit all virtual machine memory into reserved host RAM."" But that is not the default setting."

"Negative","55MBps sounds really slow for a sVmotion"
"Positive","I've been talking myself out of the gym all morning  lol"
"Positive","Are you sure you need to convert it? If you connect to the vCSA with the Workstation client, can't you drag\\-drop the VM locally?  Shouldn't need to convert vSphere to Workstation, Workstation has a newer virtual hardware version capability than vSphere 6.5."
"Positive","One thing to make absolutely sure, do you want to keep snapshots on the VMs?  For developers and testers I know at least in our environment they have a 'clean' snapshot that they revert to all the time after their testing is done, or various snapshots for different stages of testing.  Most solutions (including Veeam) will not keep the snapshots.  The only two ways that I have found to keep the snapshots during migrations like this was to SCP the data from one datastore to another or vMotion the VMs."

"Negative","Tracey Joy, I am soo sorry for your loss. Call me if you need anything hun."
"Positive","In 6.0 you have to use the installer. In 6.5 you should be able to deploy the OVA directly although I haven't tested it myself. If I recall, it should work.  You might try using the installer (which, by the way, in 6.5 is available for macOS and Linux) to see if you get a different result."
"Positive","solved it, i accidentally left in an extra bit of code from the old VMX file on the new line of code."
"Negative","Not blaming the hypervisor at all (although ESXi 6 is a buggy mess), doubt it's related but as I stated, it has been so long since I've built a physical Windows server.  Is it really that hard for someone to write ""Yes, I have this problem all the time, I just uncheck the following xxx updates and it seems to work"" rather than lobbing insults."
"Positive","If it's the only workload on the host right now, I'd try setting it at 16 vs 8 vs 4. I bet performance improves noticeably in your case the more vCPU you assign, you just need to find the sweet spot."
"Positive","What is you mail forwarder?  I would look at what TLS (SSL) cipher suites are enabled on that, as it may not have anything new (secure) enough for vCenter to now connect to."
"Positive","There's a good chance your SATA controller isn't on the HCL and therefore there are no drivers for it in ESXi, at least 6.5. You may have to try an older version like 6.0 or 5.5 and even then might have to do some tricks to inject the drivers into it. If you post some information about the system you'll be able to get more help."
"Positive","I have been so busy at work the past month. Check the top of the OP to find out more! Thanks!"
"Negative","Very weird, is it possible to power off the vm and migrate it to another host and try there?  Alternatively you could remove the cdrom, detach (but don't delete!) the disk, save the changes then re-add the cdrom and hard disk and see if it works afterwards? sounds like something is screwy with the vm configuration/controller config for some reason"

I pointed VUM to, I think, the September recipe agent updates, and got old versions. I had to manually import the correct version."

"Positive","Assuming you can license all those Windows installs, Xenserver!  It's free, low overhead, and runs on anything.  The performance of those VMs is going to depend on what box you're installing on though."
"Negative","I'm well but have been bitten this morning by a blooming insect in the garden  How's about you?"
"Negative","Major yikes.  Yeah, reverting a snapshot really needs to reset CBT if this is true.  Silently failing in such a way that leaves future backups corrupt is simply unacceptable!"

Parties are literally the only reason to go! .&lt;"
"Positive","No they're not. This was stated very clearly at VMUG by VMware employees when asked. VMware has chosen Flash and plan to stick with it. No HTML5 web client is currently being developed.   I had lunch on VMware at my office Tuesday and they reiterated this point as well  when outrsecurity guy bitched he had to have flash installed just for VMware."

"Positive","Nice video.  Did you run into any gotchas? Also, when in this process did you upgrade vCenter?"
"Positive","You only JUST realized this??\n\n:)"
"Positive","You shouldn't be quiescing the SQL database in my view. If you want to back that up, use an agent within the guest OS and snapshot the OS itself at a separate time, filtering any independent disks."
"Positive","Actually....I put in my 2 weeks notice to leave 2 days ago. Got a job at VCU."
"Negative","Fireplaces are inefficient. Thinking a very small pellet stove. Direct vent. But that's going to be $$ :("
"Positive","This is why this problem continues to cause confusion.  While neither article is really wrong in the larger question of performance, neither article really answers the question fully.  Mr Denneman's article appears to zero in on what core you will be accessing. In other words, if I tell the system there are two sockets, that does not ""force"" the scheduler to use cores from two different sockets.  The article you linked, does a great job of highlighting the problems of memory access performance when you have large VMs that actually span multiple hardware NUMA nodes.  In short, I wouldn't say the article from Achtemichuk counters. I would say it expands on maybe? I'm not sure. Either way, it's a hefty discussion and one that needs to happen more often. We have not seen CPU ready errors caused by how VMs are allocated sockets and cores, but we have seen OLTP DBs affected by badly designed large VMs spanning physical NUMA nodes."
"Negative","Ok i am officially blind. I wouldn't care but it's making me poor!!"
"Positive","I'd love to hear about those use cases (specifically around presenting SAN LUNs), because I haven't run into one yet."
"Positive","Thanks! So I had the right idea with the switch aspect, cool. Yeah I'll use a standard vSwitch, that makes sense."
"Positive","This is what I did as well; moved the vcenter server and database servers to the same host and logged into that directly.  Took SQL backups via NBU, as well as VDP full VM backups of both servers. I also took last minute snapshots of each before beginning, but luckily didn't need any of it. Took a few hours, but everything went mostly smoothly."
"Negative","Oh my look at the time! Best go get a soaking  me poor hair! just had it done yesterday ! a give up! wish a was a bloke at times!"
"Positive","You still lose the entire group if you pull the wrong drive. You are not wrong though. I have zero issues with VSAN overall, but statements like the above are not correct. Modern storage arrays are fine to. HCI has its place and will only grow."

"Positive","The new theme is only available for the fling at this time."
"Negative","I haven't used the voucher yet. Thanks for the heads up.  I should have said that I find it impossible to read on electronic media so I am looking to get the physical copy.

"Positive","PDQ Deploy is a lot easier to use and less hardware needed.  I used to be an SCCM Admin and I prefer using it as oppose to using the 800lb beast.  In a VMWare envionrment you don't need image management, you do need app and automation tools and PDQ can handle everything I need to manage deployed persistent VMs."

"Positive","Very helpful thanks! I see that in the contents doc for the 12.0.1115.0 driver so that makes sense to me that the SPP is delayed and its published early on the VMware HCL. Looks like the June update still holds the 11.4.1205.0 driver where as the HCL is reporting 11.4.1255.0 as being supported. That still confuses me.   I'll probably be deploying the 12.x version anyways if I'm going to be updating."

"Positive","Also, reading your post again, if you need a datastore, you will have to create a datastore, empty drive is required for that but just that alone won't do it, you will have to go to the ESX host and create the datastore on the disk."
"Positive","I understand your reservation but I've had to do it several times due to flaky stuff like you're experiencing. As long as you have not made network changes that cut off it's access to the management network everything should be ok. Are you running it as a VM or is it a standalone server?"
"Negative","It happens pretty much seconds after I click power on, the error I get on the BSOD is ""kernel security check failure"", I've checked both my drivers and BIOS for updates since that seems to fix that particular BSOD for others, but no luck. :/   Weirdly, I can run virtualbox just fine, this is purely isolated to VMware, which I don't understand at all."

"Positive","great. Would like to catch up if we can find the time."
"Negative","That has been my experience as well. I tried installing the hp VIB packages and got a PSOD.  I've also gotten PSOD's on 5.5u3 that came with the hp tools bundled.  Basically it's a rotten shitshow."
"Positive","Apparently it's not too easy to increase disk space of root in 6.5. I ended up pointing the backup set to /storage where I had a lot of space available, and that seems to have done the trick."

"Positive","You can upgrade the licenses as you need them for your upgrade to 6, *as long as you had been paying for support on those licenses*. So, as long as you  guys are still under support with VMWare, there won't be any cost.   Your order is correct, although I don't think there is a separate license for Update Manager.  You'll login to the VMWare website and select your vCenter 5.5 license then select upgrade. Once done you'll be emailed the key as well as the 6 key will then show up in 'My VMware'. Import that key, perform the update, apply the key."

"Positive","How many VMs for how many hosts? If it's a small operation you'll probably be fine without DRS (IMO). Regarding moving VMs during business hours vs non-business hours...If your cluster is set up correctly you won't notice anything when the VM moves to another host using regular vMotion or DRS to do it for you.

"Positive","No idea, but I don't hear about customers losing data or struggling to upgrade their Tintris or even languishing in support hell.  I'm not saying it's *bad*, just that from what I've read of it, I personally wouldn't trust it right now without some good lab/test time. The idea and (from what I've seen) execution of it, I love - just needs some more success stories out there to get over the failures I've read about. I suspect the main failing of it to be the hardware people give it, which I guess VMware can't do much about beyond having it check itself the hardware against the HCL and flagging it?"

Use it as a NAS, and you'll be MUCH happier with it than if you use it as a SAN. Using it as a SAN is asking to have a nightmare.  If your management wanted iSCSI, they should have bought a proper iSCSI SAN (Compellent, 3PAR, EMC, Equallogic, Lefthand/storevirtual, etc). Given they bought a Synology, you should go with NFS."

The only hyper visor I can think of that will let you do this Microsoft's Hyper-V on top of Windows Server and that may have changed since I last used it"
"Negative","I think the last time I did it I kept a spreadsheet with all that info for all of my hosts. I've got everything labeled so I can tell what stuff is. I think  ""Networking configuration  Host port group  vlan 2216 - iSCSI to Pure1  IP address settings  IPv4 address"" is pretty descriptive. It's annoying that I have to mouse over it to see the full thing, but it works. Of course this is 6.5Ucurrent using the HTML5 client. I remember it being more annoying in 6.0, but still not too bad. I really wish they'd just present it as a spreadsheet."

"Negative","i am a domain admin, sorry, should have mentioned that!"
"Positive","Since most people don't reserve resources at the VM level _(versus resource pools, which don't count in the Admission Control calculations)_, most Admission Control efforts seem useless.  When I had larger clusters I would set percentage-based values calculated from cluster size. But it was important to explain to people that this didn't ensure/guarantee N+1 or have much impact."

IoT is a clear and present danger to any datacenter. Never, ever discount the ability of the human condition to make your life a living hell. It's EASY to get in to a building.

"Positive","As you say it could work to move hdd to other hardware but could also result in BSOD as it might not have correct drivers etc.  PhysicalHDD2VirtualHDD :) For this i can give you one example.  Req: have hdd accessible from a machine and have another place to store the copy/image. Create a bootable usb/cd with clonezilla. Start clonezilla and make a copy of the drive to a image file. And then you  create an empy VM and start clonezilla in that VM and read in the image file you have created. Simsalabim you have Phhd2Vhdd convertion done.  EDIT: Note that you boot clonezilla on usb drive and run it as a live linux without installation. You should be able to run the GUI based version, there is advance option to do a 1:1 sector copy but that is normally not needed if drive is  not encrypted or in some other strange state."
"Positive","For what it's worth if you grab your browser and unsnap it from large mode to small floating window and back again that usually gives it a good kick in the ass.  Stupid I know but it was a good day when I realized no more refreshing."
"Negative","There are no alternatives in this case unfortunately. We have to have this vendor's software for this project. What makes this even more maddening is that the vendor in question has an option to purchase a license that lasts as little as 30 days -- but don't run that license server on VMware because fuck you.  We pay for everything we use. This is yet another case where the paying customer gets fucked while the software pirates get the better user experience."

"Positive","Dali was amazing. 200 works in one place - shame it's not travelling to brisvegas  how was davinci?"
"Positive","Considering the budget I was given I think it's somewhat solid.  I'll get them to buy Essentials, especially since they are a non-profit there would be a nice discount.  I understand I can use the one license for up to three hosts?  I'm not too worried about equipment failure as long as they stay aware of the redundant stuff failing, to stay on top of that.  They have their old host updated with 5.5 and running their redundant DC, with enough resources to bring up the VMs on the other host (they're stored on an iSCSI via Synology) in the event the server just up and dies on them.  I'm moving them to hosted Exchange to get them off 2003, so I'm not worried about their email server after next week.  As for why I want to get alerts from the device itself, I don't feel it's quite as silly as you make it sound.  If a disk or power supply fails it would email me.  If something really bad happens and the server shuts down or otherwise won't run the VMs, my monitoring/remote control agents on the Windows VMs will stop checking in and I'll get an alert.  I think that covers all my bases, insofar as being alerted.  Basically I was just looking for the server to make me aware of any warnings or alerts for the hardware it's able to monitor in Configuration  Health Status."

"Positive","Many customers, when they move to 6.0, are putting both prod and DR in the same SSO domain. This is especially beneficial if you're also using SRM as SRM can leverage Cross-vCenter-vMotion. But, its just an option. Perfectly Ok to use separate PSC domains for prod/DR. Just understand the impacts/benefits/drawbacks of each option and make a choice based on your requirements."
"Positive","On ESXi, your vSwitch0 likely has you management interface on it and a VMNICx as the uplink.  Make sure this is the VMNIC that your AirPort is connected to.  Now add a Virtual Machine portgroup to vSwitch0 for your ""LAN"".  Now create vSwitch1 and a virtualmachine portgroup for your ""WAN"" and have the VMNICx that its uplinked to connected to your ISP.  Now for pfSense VM, give it two vNICs.  One connected to WAN portgroup and one connect to LAN portgroup.  Don't specify any VLAN IDs on any of the portgroups"

"Negative","\\ they probably should express these issues with the vendor.   &amp;#x200B;  EMC ""long hair don't care"" array is in the mix here, unfortunately."
"Positive","Not how it works. You'll notice that the memory stated in your host status is XX / XY GB.  During boot, it allocates a hard line in your resources for itself. Wouldn't be much of a hypervisor if it didn't do at least that, would it?   It really doesn't need much in the way of CPU on it's own, but you can also see, if you dig in, that it allocates some reserve for that as well.   I can't find it right now (on my phone in my truck before I walk into work) but I had a white paper from VMware about how to manage host resource reservations as it relates to clusters and resource pools when managing via vCenter.  Should be able to find it with some googling if you want more technical explanations from the source."

"Positive","Is vMotion entirely irrelevant in this case?  Isn't there still the benefit of transferring a VM from one host to the other with no downtime?  (Rather than doing it manually, shutting down them VM and using scp to copy the VM to the other host which would take the VM offline for that time)  Genuinely asking, I know very little about the higher functionality of ESXi/vCenter."

"Positive","thanks! And yeah, I know! How much easier it would be to just be able to explain to the kitty, like it happens with humans"
"Positive","For the sake of correctness, the strict co-scheduling you're using as an example hasn't existed since ESXi 2.x - relaxed co-scheduling has been a thing for quite a while.  There's still a bounding on how much scheduling delta is allowed between vCPUs, which can still be seen as an increase in CSTP times, but it hasn't been an ""all or nothing"" situation for quite some time."
"Positive","I too forget from time to time not everyone had enterprise plus lol"
"Positive","For what you are describing there you could run it on a single ESXi host. A typical host in our cluster is a Dell R730 with 2x20 core@2.3GHz CPUs and 768GB RAM, plus a decently fast NAS that gets shared with all the hosts. That host would run to about $20K but would do everything you talk about 5 times over.  The issue you have with a single host is redundancy. Servers these days are pretty good, but only you know how much you could cope with downtime and how much risk you could afford to take.  On a tight budget you could look at something like proxmox instead, which is actually pretty similar to VMware at the starter levels. And free."

"Positive","YES! My VMware team has started converting all our blades to AutoDeploy. With 300+ hosts, it makes our upgrade processes quicker. We also bake in things like vendor drivers and trend into the image so it cuts down on our deployment time."

"Negative","First time boarding Southwest. This is ridiculous. ""The flight is oversold"" never happens on @JetBlue"
"Positive","We're using Skyline.  Though, I was recently granted access (couple days ago).  Does it take time for permissions to Advisor and such to take effect?  Also, in Advisor, it shows a lot of our inventory, but some clusters do not have a drop down and show individual hosts.  We did a rolling 6.7 upgrade a couple days ago, but I would think the collection is more frequent?  Can you talk about the polling/discovery timers?"

"Positive","You will probably need to create another connection server set and a new pool on your LB, if you're wanting to use the same DNS name externally you should be able to use custom rules on your LB to change which load balanced pool of servers is being used by external users vs internal.  Alternatively you could present a different DNS record externally and point it to another VIP on your LB.   Just out of curiosity which LB are you using?"

It seems to work really well and is quite simple to configure and manage.  All of our clients seem to be impressed with its actual recovery time of the VM's.  Zerto also has pretty good support, every time I've called or emailed them they've been pretty responsive."

"Positive","That's an interesting approach. And yeah, I'm wondering how long VMware is going to play nice with the NSX portion.  Can you do scheduled scans with this approach? Is it less resource intensive than a full agent on the VM?"
"Positive","Install VMware tools and it'll resize automatically"
"Positive","Looking into it now. Thanks for the pointer."
"Negative","I have a similar dilemma but in a University setting. Have not tried implementing this but in theory it sounds like it should work. The PCoIP server process (pcoip_server_win32.exe) is what draws the PCoIP screen. My thought was to limit the IP subnet that could connect to that process. If a user inadvertently selects the wrong pool in the wrong location they'll be greeted with a black screen and eventually will be disconnected or they could disconnect themselves. So you'd have to educate your users accordingly.  Edit: just read this is an application, so this might not work for you then if the app needs to know the MAC. Desktop wise this might work."
"Positive","Thanks.  I think we are going to try it out.  Was just initially pushing back due to the change in the infrastructure.   Did you guys start out with this config from the start or did you change things midstream?"

At one point we were using tsmve and it was really bad about leaving snaps, so I had this running every 6 hours looking for tsm snaps that were older than a certain amount of hours.  It would automatically delete them to prevent them from taking another snap before the first was deleted."

"Positive","Well, now that there is a March 2018 30% off coupon for upgrade to 14 Pro from 12 I think I'm going to upgrade our two workstation licenses.  I've had to recently upgrade the vmtool in our 12.5.9 workstation Windows guest VMs from 10.1 to 10.2 because shared folders between host and guests quit working after recent windows update.   and 10.2 was supposedly only certified for 14 Pro and not 12 Pro.

"Positive","Support just confirmed that patch is not in 6.7U1, but is expected to be in U2."
"Positive","I really have to advocate for you not going through with that plan. That is not a great idea, even when perfectly executed. Can you not leave it internal, and get a jump box or something to get in and access it? Then you can set external firewall rules up to access the servers that you need on it."
"Negative","'In the desktop and application selection window"".  What the heck is that and how do I find it?"
"Positive","yeah I might just open a ticket with Cisco to be safe too.."
"Positive","Yep, once you've got the ESXi host up and running you can connect to it through the vSphere Client.  vCenter Server in my experience is used when you have multiple ESXi hosts you want to configure from one place, it lets you join them all and manage them at once (Through the vSphere Client)"

Check the following:  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Volatile Environment\\ViewClient_Machine_Name  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Volatile Environment\\ViewClient_IP_Address  If memory serves, there's more in that location if you need it as well.  You can make custom fields in BGinfo to pull that info and put it in your BGinfo."

"Negative","Given your experience it seems like you wouldn't be qualified for the job but it's pretty hard to say given the information provided. If that's the entire job posting then you'll probably need additional information."
"Positive","Well, that's one way to do it but this (albeit pointless) requirement doesn't necessitate any sort of remote delivery. You could do it locally using ESXi and nothing else, apart from equal parts patience and desire to spend your time doing something pointless. For someone who's not very familiar with esxi already, it's never going to happen.  FWIW, the VADC plugin works with vDGA so you don't need a view server or vcenter server to do it, just a single win7 VM. Oh and tera1 is absolutely adequate too, with the dual screen limitation of vdga and vSGA, there's no performance difference. Most improvements with t2 are around hardware pcoip and new features/security."

I don't directly support Hyper-V but our product can run on top of it along with other hypervisors so I tried to help him out. I ended up having to send him to Microsoft support who worked with him for about a week. They couldn't figure out how to get the cluster working either. Honestly his problem was he was trying to reuse some existing hosts without reinstalling Windows so I think someone before him really jacked up the installs and he didn't want to rebuild them. Still the more I touch Hyper-V the less I like it."

"Positive","she's not ugly!! She's gorgeous  ... She's my baby! Lol"
"Positive","Remote Desktop isn't nearly as hard on the systems as doing full blown VDI, currently the RD farm is running on just a few normal hosts served storage via iSCSI. The users generally don't need to run very heavy apps at all so hard drive speed isn't a huge issue for us. The SAN is set up in RAID10 with a fair quantity of disks and it seems to be doing a good job of keeping up with our needs as it stands.  In a farm of 2-4 RD servers the need to go to templates isn't that crucial either, it would be more elegant that way but it's also not  crucial, as it would be for a full blown VDI setup where you're looking at dozens of virtual machines.  So literally just switching protocols to get a more responsive remote experience is what I'd like to see.  The whole thing is a holdover from an earlier install, just translated to a virtualized envionment, so we're still rocking the ""good old"" roaming profiles and group policy, that too probably does need to be looked at.   So right now I'm just trying to get a better grasp of how you go from a bog-standard vSphere setup with a SAN backend to having Horizon Advanced on there and serving RDHS via PCoIP."

"Positive","Ahah a VM named BOINC grinding the CPUs and pushing  21% Co-Stops;  no wonder it's broke. /s.  Actually, it usually means the terminal has cat'ed some binary junk  that contained control sequences taking the terminal out of normal character mode  In these situations; try  reset   or   stty sane; tput rs1 ; tput reset ; setterm -reset  or      stty sane     echo -e '\\033c'     echo -e ' \\x63\\x1B\\x5B\\x1B\\x70\\x21\\x5B\\x1B\\x33\\x3F\\x34\\x3B\\x1B\\x6C\\x34\\x5b\\x1b\\x6c\\x00\\x3E'     clear"
"Positive","Veeam's preferred architecture is to have 3-7 restore points on disk - SAN ideally over NAS and then keep long-term retention in a tape or other WORM/airgap type of protocol.   This gives you fast restores and the ability to spin up a VM on the disk target,  but without a single protocol that can be infected with malware.     Virtual tape is a great resource for the second part - provides the speed of disk but the security of tape.   Some other options include cloud-based object storage."
"Positive","in the past there were notable issues with vmware tools being out of date (performance, stability) of which there is zero mention herere"
"Negative","I set up a [Lenny](/r/itslenny) instance on my Asterisk box a while back and used that number for my VMworld registration. Looking forward to the calls!  I did warn a few vendors to e-mail and not call, but I have no sympathy for the ones who literally grabbed my badge when I walked past."

"Positive","And say goodbye to having control over your own infrastructure. The cloud is awesome, till it's down and you have C level execs threatening your children's college fund and you can't do shit except sit there and play twiddle your thumbs till they get it fixed.   I can guarantee some level of performance and fault tolerance. All the way up to 'never ever goes down'. It all depends on how much money you have and how badly you want it to stay up. I can also guarantee physical security if I keep my hardware in a locked room.  Too many question marks for me. The cloud has burned lots of people that put all their eggs in one basket."

"Positive","In the cluster my team manages we're using Dell R710's and R720's due to customer budget.  Another department uses UCS but they have a larger budget than our customer (we're a MSP for the customer).  This summer we're rolling out a new VCE Vblock environment for one of our customers SAP infrastructure.  Looking forward to the VBlock setup as it's essentially UCS + EMC storage + VMware and I won't have to deal with the bios updating nightmare we go through now.  Hopefully if all goes well within the next 2 years all of the Dell R710/R720 servers will be replaced with the VBlock solution."

"Positive","I agree, it does have a ways to go before I will move to it from VMs. I also think it is the future, it's a better version of the status quo (VMs on a hypervisor). It seems like Project Pacific could be the first user-friendly kubernetes solution.... if only they'd release it."

"Positive","Nice!! I miss playing with physical hardware :( I spent five years as a sys admin/infra engineer and am now in a support engineer/consultant type role. I will say that not having to deal with on call and maintenance windows anymore is nice though!"

"Positive","I'm glad someone else thinks these things through.  :-)  Most of the advice I got when investigating was to reconfigure my NFS server to ignore the sync flag to ""speed things up.""  I figure that my server shouldn't second-guess client requests centering around data integrity.  With that said, it was pretty clear by viewing packet traces that ESXi 5.1 as an NFS client was making some pretty poor choices.  EVERY write does not need to be a synchronous write...  The ""magic"" is that ESXi does not request every iSCSI write to be synchronous-- only important ones (e.g. metadata updates.)  It could use the same logic on NFS... but it doesn't.  The storage still fully honors sync flags when requested, because I wasn't about to disable a key data integrity feature.  I'm funny like that.  :-)"
"Negative","u/n0exec, the OVF limitation is a ""feature"" of this build of 6.7.  Not available yet.  And if they won't sync the template format to subscribed sites, Content Library is useless to us.  :("
"Positive","This is a good point. I started like this due to the fact that we had incorrect or outdated information which I could not ignore due to the political stature of the outgoing admin with the still-current bossy man.   This despite my wanting to use them in the first place.   However, I'm thinking that this means I need to have a 10GB backbone plus the isolated iSCI I already have. Right now, I don't really have this, but I DID just get a 10GB switch just for doing vMotion, so I might be able to convert that for use into my core switches.   It's a bit messy in one rack due to all the excess cabling and the weird approaches to cabling up to now. I'll have to think on the best approach to all this, while I'm getting the rest of my network VLANned."

It does changed block tracking so the initial replication job may take a little bit of time (just use replica seeding so it doesn't take forever) but after that replicas are SUPER fast.

"Positive","I wouldn't worry about failing storage shelves. The only time this is a consideration is in super high availability systems; in such designs, you will see the designer deploying patterns such as: purchase 8 entire shelves, and then create your RAID sets out of one drive from each shelf. But these sorts of designs are the kind that most folks never see in their careers. They are typically only used for systems where either lives or lots and lots of money are on the line."

Getting all of the onesy-twosy hardware devices working properly using thin clients was the PITA.  Just found out that our EMV card readers won't work with thin clients because they present as COM ports and the Linux View Client doesn't redirect COM ports, only Windows supports COM redirection."
